The 12,000-square-foot house on just under 2 acres was once listed for lease at $125,000 PER MONTH, but the Harveys were able to talk the owners down to $110,000 per month. That works out to about $1.3 million in rent per year. The house was listed for sale for $23.5 million at one point in 2007.</p><p>Outside of Los Angeles, Steve Harvey owns a 9,000-square-foot mansion in Atlanta that he purchased in 2010 for $3.4 million, as well as a 4-acre mansion outside of Dallas, Texas.

Marjorie rocked the show in some of her most recognizable outfits, including a daring blazer dress, a white scarf top ensemble, and a timeless little black dress. But she also wore an all-black attire, which may have slipped Family Feud fans’ notice.</p><p>Marjorie shared a series of images on Instagram on July 5 in which she was seen sporting what appeared to be leather trousers and a halter top. The top was backless and featured a keyhole pattern with gold hardware accents.</p><p>Marjorie noted in the photographs that she finished the appearance with a black clutch purse and stiletto shoes. She also wore her hair in a straight ponytail and accessorized with understated gold. Steve didn’t take long to express his opinion to her after seeing her amazing dress. He left a “❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️” remark on his wife’s Instagram post.</p><p>Family Feud followers also stopped by Marjorie’s Instagram comments section without missing a beat. Unbelievable, a commenter wrote. “🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 You look fantastic,” a second person chimed in. “Mrs. Harvey, you are incredibly gorgeous! Just stunning! “,” a different supporter chimed in.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Marjorie Harvey (@marjorie_harvey)</a></p><p>The costume isn’t seen in any Instagram or TikTok videos, but Marjorie undoubtedly shone on the Parisian streets. Steve has previously discussed how she altered his sense of style. He said to E! News in an interview that Marjorie engaged his stylist Elly Karamoh to upgrade his wardrobe.</p><p>“Steve, look, you’ve been on TV, you have a brand, and you’ve safeguarded it for so long,” she continued. People never see how you dress when you’re not on TV,” “He told the publication. “I want you to begin dressing as you do offstage, but I’m going to get you some help because you don’t have time to go shopping.”</p><p>Steve finally thought that the solution was simple.
