Your favorite celebrities—including rappers—are doing less and less press, but luckily their thumbs and smartphones still work. Instagram has provided a way for them to document their lives and/or thoroughly embarrass themselves for our collective enjoyment. The beauty of it all is that you don’t even need to join Instagram, as most rappers are perfectly fine leaving their feeds open for public viewing. And if you’d rather avoid the IG life altogether, we’ve filtered through the top rapper’s pictures and videos and consolidated all the week’s events into one convenient feed.</p><p>This week, Kanye West and Kim Kardashian get bombarded by the paparazzi (again) at Paris Fashion Week and Swizz Beatz shares a group picture from the 1999 “Hard Knock Life” tour.</p><h2>Drake Got An Emoji Tattoo</h2><p>Aubrey got some tattoos over the weekend and I’m not sure what’s worse, Drake getting an emoji “praying hands” tattoo or Drake getting an emoji “high five” tattoo. The <a href=#>debate</a> over whether the character is a high five or praying hands is one that will continue until the end of time, but you know how the saying goes, “life is what u make it haaa.” Let’s hope Drake’s emoji tattoo isn’t the beginning of a new trend of permanently inked characters, since there is a total of <a href=#>722 options</a>.

Going on its second season, Dream School is set to air its first episode on October 1st on The Sundance Channel. The purpose of the show is to help students who are struggling. Each teen is linked with a celebrity mentor, which is where 50 comes in.

The shortstop in pinstripes wrapped up his 20th season with the New York Yankees, a team he’s been with since he was first drafted to the MLB in 1995. Jay, appropriately wearing the NY fitted, sat in the crowd to watch the Yankees play the Baltimore Orioles. Not sure who got him to smile in this picture but the grin is definitely meme-worthy. Caption: “Hat cocked, can’t see his eyes, who could it be? #re2pect.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><h2>Nicki Minaj Visits August Alsina In The Hospital</h2><p>Nicki Minaj shows her love and care for good friend August Alsina by paying him a visit in the hospital. Alsina had recently collapsed during a show in New York and was carried out of the venue on a stretcher. This lead to a three-day coma before Nicki showed up, as he currently remains hospitalized. The two recently worked together, as Nicki is featured on the remix of “No Love,” a track off his debut album Testimony. Caption: “August, u know, I’m here to save u. still praying for my lil bro. He’s doing better.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><h2>Kanye West At Paris Fashion Week</h2><p>The topic of the holes in Kanye West’s black pants has been brought to my attention many times this week, probably because he’s been wearing the pants (could be the same one or he could have five) to almost every event during Paris Fashion Week. Here’s a picture of Kanye and Kim sitting front row at&nbsp; Lanvin’s Spring/Summer 2015 show in Paris. Not only did his pants have the large infamous knee holes spoken of earlier, the <a href=#>duo was also booed</a> by runway photographers when they arrived late to the show. Of course, <a href=#>Kanye responded</a> to the heckling. The “lateness” was actually before the show actually started, which was already running 40 minutes late. Caption: “Kanye & Kim front row at the Lanvin SS15 show in Paris.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><h2>Beyonce’s Official 2015 Calendar</h2><p>Did anyone else think the month of September flew by in a blink of an eye? The good news is that we are that much closer to 2015, which means that much closer to putting up this Beyoncé calendar. This official 2015 calendar, featuring 12 glossy images and a centerfold, is available now at shop.beyonce.com. Let’s just hope it fits in a Christmas stocking.

In the <a href=#>music video</a> for the DJ Paul and Juicy J-produced track, Andre plays a kilt-wearing wearing groom who’s about to say “I do” to the girl of his dreams and therefore, giving up his life as a player. The video marked the last music video appearance from Pimp C, who passed away later that year. Beverly is currently writing a biography on Pimp C, stating that she’s interviewed more than 250 people for the book. Read more about it <a href=#>here</a>.

The tour, which was packed with rap all-stars, even had its own documentary film titled Backstage, produced by Damon Dash. As you can see in the throwback picture Swizz Beatz shared of the tour, Jay Z, DMX, Method Man, Swizz, Damon Dash, DJ Clue and more were all grouped together for a tour family photo. Caption: “#tbt great times 1999 ………. I had no hair on my face yet.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><h2>Slowbucks Takes Picture With 50’s Son… Again</h2><p>Former G Unit affiliate Slowbucks took to Instagram again to post a photo with 50 cent’s son, Marquise Jackson. Months prior, he had posted a photo with Marquise and Trav, an artist 50 is fueding with. 50 voices his opinion by commenting,&nbsp; “This picture was a bad idea” for the world to see. Weeks later, Slowbucks was jumped and had his chain stolen at a G Unit performance at Summer Jam. Clearly, Slowbucks isn’t afraid. Caption: “My lil bro @199viq came threw 2day & kicked it with me .. We stopped in the 50’s & checked my n%a @Meech_TheBoss out & cleared the racks out over @GetSetNYC then went threw Da 90’s 2 check @Bz718 & Da #GSC BOYZ #BQE sh!t F%k all that negative sh!t this is #Family sh!t #LikeDis”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><h2>Bow Wow and Love & Hip Hop’s Erica Mena Engaged</h2><p>Bow Wow and Love & Hip Hop’s Erica Mena are engaged, as Bow Wow confirms by posting a photo of them at the BET Hip Hop Awards, alongside a close up shot of Mena’s diamond ring on her hand. Thank goodness he became the host of BET’s 106 And Park, or else the two would have never met. After only dating for six months, Shad Moss believes he has found the love of his life.
