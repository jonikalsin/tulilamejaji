This was around the same time and place where author Mark Twain would later set his picturesque novels about Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, though there wasn’t a lot of whitewashing and river rafting going on in the James family.</p><p>Jesse James’ natural father, Robert, was a slave-owning Baptist preacher from Kentucky who was always looking for the next big score that would make him rich.</p><p>When his hemp farm didn’t pan out in Kentucky, Robert James moved to Missouri to try his hand at cotton. When his six slaves and 100 acres failed to make him a millionaire there, he packed light and moved to California to get in on the Gold Rush.</p><p>The elder James then died in California in 1850, never having made the fortunes he was hoping for, and his widow took three-year-old Jesse James and his older brother <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Frank James</a> back to the family farm where she remarried within a couple of years.</p><p>The James farm led a quiet life for the next decade or so, though that quietude did not mean peace.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-226209 alt="Jesse And Frank James Side By Side" width=600 height=954 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/jesse-frank-james.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-226209 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>Jesse and Frank James in 1872.</span></p><p>1850s Missouri was right next to the opening act of America’s Civil War — and the James family was in the thick of it.</p><p>The trouble started with the 1854 Kansas-Nebraska Act. The Act permitted territories to each vote on whether they would be admitted into the Union as a free or a slave state. Nobody even tried to make Nebraska a slave state, but Kansas was right on the cusp of going either way. If slavery was abolished in Kansas, Missouri’s slaveholders feared that their enslaved laborers would escape there.</p><p>Jesse James thus grew up in one of the most pro-slavery counties in the state, and as slave owners themselves, the James family’s sympathy laid entirely with pro-slavery raiders. These raiders wound up staging wildly fraudulent elections to make Kansas a slave territory. The fighting between pro and anti-slavery forces lasted 12 years in a period known as Bleeding Kansas, until the end of the war.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-226203 alt="Jesse James Portrait" width=600 height=838 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/jesse-james-suit.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-226203 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Public Domain</span><span class=caption-body>A portrait of Jesse James wearing a suit. Circa 1864.</span></p><p>As the Civil War raged out West, wild bands of raiders and outlaws struck deep into each other’s territory to slaughter civilians without mercy. Hangings, lynchings, and scalpings were routine on both sides.</p><p>Jesse James’ stepfather Reuben, for example, was seized by Union troops in 1863 and tortured for information about his team of guerilla Confederate fighters called “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">bushwhackers</a>.”</p><p>The troops hoisted him by the neck with a noose tossed over a branch until he passed out, and also allegedly tied up the 16-year-old Jesse James and gave him a lashing despite the fact that he hadn’t been involved in any of the raids up to that point.</p><h2>A Guerilla Confederate</h2><p>Previously too young to join in the rebellions, perhaps this personal act of violence against James was the impetus for his joining up with the Confederate guerilla militia.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-226200 alt="Young Jesse James With Gun" width=600 height=779 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/jesse-james-1864.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-226200 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Public Domain</span><span class=caption-body>A portrait of a young Jesse James.

Bloody Bill led the James boys and his unit in the now-infamous raid on Centralia where they killed several unarmed civilians and collected their scalps.</p><p>The group then attacked a train of wounded and deactivated Union soldiers, killing at least 100 men. Jesse and Frank James rode down the fleeing survivors and shot every man who tried to surrender including the Army major in command.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-226201 alt="James Brothers Charles And Fletcher" width=600 height=855 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/james-brothers-charles-fletcher.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-226201 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Public Domain</span><span class=caption-body>Jesse James (right) poses with brother Frank James (seated) and Charles Fletcher Taylor (left); Frank is wearing a “Civil War studio costume.”</span></p><p>The end of the war saw Missouri occupied and under martial law. The Emancipation Proclamation hadn’t affected the state, which had remained officially neutral during the war, but in 1866 the 13th and 14th Amendments abolished slavery in every territory.</p><p>With that, much of the wealth in the James family vanished and the boys turned to crime. Jesse James had been shot in the chest during the War and was nursed back to health by his first cousin who he later married.</p><p>When he recovered, outlaw Jesse James took part in a jailbreak that freed several members of his guerilla gang under leader Archie Clement. But when Clement was later killed, Jesse James took over the gang and led several daring bank robberies including one in Richmond, Missouri, that saw the town’s mayor killed.</p><p>Together the James brothers committed countless small-scale robberies over the next few years, though their gang gradually lost members to death in action, arrests, and lynchings.</p><p>Lost in the din of underground resistance activity, the outlaws of the James Gang went largely unnoticed until December 1869, when Jesse James outright murdered a bank cashier he mistook for the Union officer who had killed his old boss, Bloody Bill.</p><p>A huge manhunt was organized to catch the killers, but Frank and Jesse James’ ability to evade capture quickly bore their legend.</p><h2>The James-Younger Gang</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-226210 alt="Jesse James Train Robbery" width=900 height=585 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/jesse-james-train-robbery.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-226210 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Digital Public Library</span><span class=caption-body>An illustration by Donald Jay, dated 1882, depicting a train robbery by Jesse James and his gang.</span></p><p>Probably the biggest factor in James’ rise to fame was the symbiotic relationship he fell into with the publishers of the Kansas City Star, a firmly pro-Confederate paper that constantly editorialized anti-Reconstruction policies.</p><p>The paper’s editor sensed an opportunity in Jesse James. He envisioned the outlaw as a symbol of the resistance and consequently gave James endless print space to publicize his rebellions against the Republicans.</p><p>Jesse James wrote himself as the titular leader of an eight-man posse called the James-Younger Gang, which consisted of Cole Younger and his brothers John, Jim, and Bob, and other former Confederates.</p><p>James and his men spent several years robbing banks all over the region, retrofitting their criminal exploits to garner as much attention as possible while portraying themselves as heroes of the Confederacy — Robin Hoods, of sorts — catering to the lost voices of disenfranchised Confederates.</p><p>“We are not thieves,” Jesse James reportedly wrote, “we are bold robbers.

When they got the commission to capture Jesse James, the Pinkertons moved a little too fast and got caught in an ambush, where a deputy sheriff and several of the agency’s men were shot.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-243965 alt="Jesse James In Color" width=600 height=753 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/jesse-james-in-color.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-243965 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons; colorized by Matt Loughrey</span><span class=caption-body>A colorized portrait of a young Jesse James.</span></p><p>After that, Allan Pinkerton himself led the manhunt, the climax of which was a raid at the James farm that intentionally turned into a sneak arson attack when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Pinkertons threw a firebomb</a> through the window.</p><p>That bomb killed Jesse James’ younger half-brother who was sleeping at the time and injured his mother. Pinkerton later denied burning the house down on purpose, though research a century later turned up a letter in which Pinkerton bragged about what he planned to do.</p><p>After the malicious wounding of a woman and the death of a boy, the Pinkertons withdrew, having been utterly defeated by the James brothers.</p><h2>The Northfield Bank Fiasco And The Downfall Of The James-Younger Gang</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-226180 alt="Dick Liddil" width=600 height=763 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dick-liddil.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-226180 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>A photograph of Dick Liddill, one of the last surviving members of the James-Younger gang.</span></p><p>Jesse James went on a killing spree after the attack on his house.</p><p>Several local collaborators suspected of having worked with the Pinkertons turned up dead in their homes. The James-Younger gang became more selective about their targets, favoring banks and other properties owned by Republicans. One of these, the Northfield Bank in Minnesota, would mark the turning point in the fortunes of Frank and Jesse James.</p><p>The Northfield Bank robbery went down on September 7, 1876. That morning, the James-Younger Gang rode into town and converged on the bank. Two of the outlaws took up sentry positions outside while the rest of the robbers went in to crack the safe. Surprisingly, the clerk had the nerve to lie and tell them that the safe was on a time lock, even though one of the robbers was holding a Bowie knife to his throat.</p><p>As the clerk received a beating that left his skull cracked, townspeople grew suspicious of the lookouts and started a confrontation outside the bank.</p><p>The sentries shot into the air to clear the street, which soon turned into a gunfight. The men inside the bank dropped what they were doing and, pausing only to shoot the clerk who’d held them up, made a run for it. Local law enforcement was already converging on the scene and the gang fled.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-226178 alt="Frank James" width=600 height=746 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/frank-james.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-226178 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>Portrait of Frank James, Jesse James’ older brother.</span></p><p>Frank and Jesse James recovered from the Northfield disaster but didn’t keep much of a low profile as they continued to rob trains, stores, and the like. Frank James seemed to have reformed. He renounced his outlaw lifestyle and moved to Virginia for what he hoped would be a quiet retirement. Jesse James, however, couldn’t stay away from crime.</p><p>He assembled a new mob which proved difficult to keep together, even for a quick-on-the-trigger killer like Jesse James, who may have murdered one of his own men to keep him from giving himself up. By 1882, James was living with the last two members of his gang who hadn’t run off or died, Charley and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert Ford</a>.</p><p>According to their later account, James had made a few inappropriate comments and overtures toward their sister, Martha, not to mention the fact that there was a hefty $5,000 bounty on James’ head dead or alive. At least these are the reasons that the Ford brothers cited after the death of Jesse James.</p><h2>The Death Of Jesse James</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-226182 alt="Jesse James Death" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/robert-ford-jesse-james.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-226182 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>An illustration that depicts that grisly death of Jesse James at the hands of his criminal collaborator, Robert Ford.</span></p><p>On April 3, 1882, the morning of a planned robbery, Jesse James got up and ate breakfast.
