But only time will tell whether they’ll work things out as Giovanni is so busy.”</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>“He’s been focusing on Strictly, training his celeb partner Rose 24/7, and they’ve become really good friends. He's even been learning sign language from Rose, showing it off on social media.</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Maura’s decided to take a step back and let him concentrate on the show.”</span></strong></p><p><span>Her boyfriend recently broke his silence on the split rumors saying, <strong>“Great relationships with great people can come to a natural end. This has been the case for me recently. There was absolutely no wrongdoing and this should be the end of any speculation.”</strong></span></p><h2><strong><span>Net Worth Of Maura Higgins</span></strong></h2><p><span>The Irish media personality and model Maura Higgins has an <a href=# rel=noopener>estimated net worth</a> of $1 million.
